λ Calculus "Term", E

E ::= V           [where v is a variable]
      | λ V . E   [lambda expression]
      | E E       [application]

V ::= x | y | z | a | b | ...

Notation:
  - parens used for grouping
  - λ-expressions extend as far to the right as possible
    (λ x . x x) y
    λ x . x x y = λ x . (x x y)
  - application is "left associative":
    x y z = (x y) z
  - all λ-expressions have one variable,
    multivariate is shorthand (sugar) for curried
     λ x y z . e = λ x . λ y . λ z . e = λ x . (λ y . (λ z . e))

Q: Why write λv.e instead of v→e ?
A: Church's typewriter didn't have unicode.

In differential calculus, have "reduction"
   (d/dx)(u*v)  -->  (u)*(d/dx)(v) + (d/dx)(u)*(v)

In λ-calc, one reduction, called β-reduction

   (λ v . e1) e2    -->    [e2/v]e1      (where [e2/v] means replace instances of v by e2)

where variables have to be renamed if necessary.
